# Hello, I am Welton.

## About Me

I am Data Scientist with a BSc in Computer Science and a MSc in AI/NLP. I began my journey in data science during my research period as an undergrad student, where I was responsible for developing systems for classification and characterization of phishing emails and URLs. During this time, I gained ample experince in different strategies for managing and analyzing data on a global scale, where I was first introduced to NLP, developing models for analyzing the content of malicious emails and web pages.

During my Master's, I researched the performance of stacking models for automatic document classification. At the same time, I deepened my knowledge in supervised learning methods, document representation, and ensemble learning. This opportunity allowed me to utilize LLMs and apply fine-tuning techniques to build more powerful ensembles. Alongside developing my Master's thesis, I worked as a data scientist with a focus on NLP, developing systems for duplicate ad detection, copyright infringement detection for trademark registration, sentiment analysis, and audience characterization. More recently, I have been developing conversational agents for customer automation and support for various businesses.
